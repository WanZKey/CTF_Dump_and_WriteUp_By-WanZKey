Digging for Dinosaurs
125
I made this image to show a nice collection of my favorite dinosaurs. It's pretty cool as it is, but legend says that if you dig around enough, you might be able to find my most favorite secret dinosaur hidden within, but only if you know where a steg might hide. Poke around, find the passkey, and dig out the secret dino to get the flag.
