No Flags, Inc.
150
Our company, No Flags, Inc., just sent this monthly report out informing us of our continued intentional lack of flags. Unfortunately, we think someone intercepted it and figured out how to add a flag in there. Please find the flag that was hidden in the report so we can get our company back to being completely flag free!
