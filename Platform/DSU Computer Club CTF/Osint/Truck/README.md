Truck
100
I want to know what happened to the dealership my truck was bought from, but all I have are my keys. The leather is a bit worn, but I can at least make out that it says "Vern Sims". Must've been a cool guy if he sold this epic of a truck. What is the auditor file number of the document in which he sold his dealership's land to the next owner?
