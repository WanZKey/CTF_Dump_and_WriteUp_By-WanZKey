We are tracking a group of criminals who seem to be attempting to compromise Wi-Fi access points at certain locations. We intercepted this list from them that we think might give us a clue as to where they've visited. Intelligence tells us they're headed to their next target now, but if you're quick we might be able to take action first. What is the latest recorded BSSID of the 5 GHz Wi-Fi access point at their next target?

1. Everyone's always on about A1 sauce but I bet these guys like A34 more
2. once you find the location and the tool for finding the BSSID, use advanced search for freenets within a small radius around the location
